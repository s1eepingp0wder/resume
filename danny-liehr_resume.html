<h2 style="font-size:4em; margin-top: -1px; margin-bottom: -10px;">About Me</h2>
<p><strong>Ever since I was a child, I've wanted to find ways to make a computer match my creative thought.</strong> Every child dreams big, and I was no exception. I started my journey into development of various programs and media when I was about 11 or 12.</p>
<p>The want became a need after a few injuries to my head left me disabled on a technicality. Right now, I'm not supposed to be unsupervised, in case of a seizure or black-out. With no means of properly explaining the situation to a person, I turned to robots to be what I lean on. Said project has introduced me to Terminal commands, SSH (Secure Shell), and NodeJS.</p>
